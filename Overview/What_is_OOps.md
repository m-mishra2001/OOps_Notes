# Overview
## What is OOPs 
OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming.**

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code.

The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
