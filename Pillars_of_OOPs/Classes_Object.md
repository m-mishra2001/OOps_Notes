# Classes
Class are a blueprint or a set of instructions to build a specific type of object.
Class in Java determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain.
Class does not occupy memory.

A class in java can contain:

• data member

• method

• constructor

• nested class and 

• interface


# Objects
It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, 
which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : 

State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
